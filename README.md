## 🔧 Utilities

This repository includes helper functions to standardize input/output formats across the group.

* **Hex -> Binary**: Converts Hex strings (e.g., `1122AA`) to bit vectors.
* **Binary -> Hex**: Converts bit vectors back to Hex strings.
* **Hex Char -> Int**: Safe conversion helper (handles errors).

**Note:** Use these to ensure compatibility between the Task 4 output and Task 6 input.
